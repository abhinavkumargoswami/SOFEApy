# SOFEApy

This package is a python port of the original Single-shot Optical Flow Estimation Algorithm (SOFEA), A Non-iterative and Robust Optical Flow Estimation Algorithm for Dynamic Vision Sensors. The original implementation is in MATLAB. It is available at https://bitbucket.org/wengfei_nus/sofea/src/master/
A brief introduction of the method is in the following video.
